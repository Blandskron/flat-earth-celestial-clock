# ECLIPSE PREDICTIONS  
## Flat Earth Celestial Clock vs Orbital Astronomy

---

## Purpose

This document exists to state something explicitly:

> The Flat Earth Celestial Clock produces eclipse predictions  
> that are **structurally comparable** to those produced by orbital astronomy.

This comparison is not philosophical.  
It is **temporal, categorical, and falsifiable**.

---

## Methodological Position

This model does **not** attempt to replicate NASA tables.

It does not ingest:
- orbital elements,
- spacecraft telemetry,
- gravitational parameters,
- relativistic corrections.

All predictions emerge exclusively from:

- synodic lunar phase,
- harmonic solar analemma,
- draconic nodal timing,
- and deterministic temporal refinement.

The only shared variable between models is **time**.

---

## Prediction Scope

The model produces:

- solar eclipses
- lunar eclipses
- subtype classification:
  - total
  - annular
  - partial
  - penumbral

Across multi-decade ranges.

No post-hoc fitting is performed.

Reference anchoring is fixed and declared.

## Structural Comparison (Conceptual)

| Aspect | Orbital Astronomy | Celestial Clock |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Earth geometry | Spherical | Planar |
| Motion driver | Gravity | Time synchronization |
| Eclipse cause | Shadow mechanics | Angular–temporal alignment |
| Analemma role | Artifact | Control parameter |
| Nodal logic | Inclined planes | Temporal windows |
| Prediction method | Orbital propagation | Harmonic resonance |

Two incompatible ontologies.  
One shared outcome.

## Why Matching Predictions Matter

If two models:
- disagree on geometry,
- disagree on causality,
- disagree on physical narrative,

yet **predict the same discrete events**,

then prediction alone **cannot validate ontology**.

This does not disprove orbital astronomy.

It proves that orbital astronomy is **not uniquely required**.

---

## On Error and Tolerance

No predictive system is exact.

This model declares:
- phase tolerances,
- nodal windows,
- refinement bounds.

Errors are bounded, repeatable, and transparent.

Unlike orbital models, no correction terms are hidden behind force laws.

---

## Falsifiability

This model is falsified if:

- eclipse predictions fail consistently,
- subtype distributions collapse,
- nodal periodicity drifts irreparably,
- or harmonic coherence breaks over time.

Until then, dismissal without analysis is non-scientific.

---

## Final Statement

This project does not claim superiority.

It claims **non-exclusivity**.

Once non-exclusivity is established,
the monopoly of explanation collapses.

Time alone is sufficient to govern the sky.
