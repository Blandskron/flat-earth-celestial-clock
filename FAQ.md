# FAQ  
## Flat Earth Celestial Clock

---

### Q1: Is this a joke or satire?

No.

This is a deterministic mathematical model.
It produces concrete predictions.
It uses explicit assumptions.

Satire does not require equations.

---

### Q2: Are you denying gravity?

Gravity is not required by this model.

That is not denial.
That is non-use.

A variable that is unnecessary is not refuted — it is bypassed.

---

### Q3: Are you claiming mainstream astronomy is fake?

No.

Mainstream astronomy is **interpretive**.

It is one valid framework among others.

This project demonstrates that it is **not the only possible one**.

---

### Q4: Why assume a flat Earth at all?

Because it forces the model to operate
without:
- curvature,
- rotation,
- relativistic corrections,
- or spatial inertia.

If the model still works under maximal constraint,
the assumptions being removed were never essential.

---

### Q5: Why should anyone take this seriously?

Because it makes falsifiable predictions.

If the eclipse tables fail,
the model fails.

There is no appeal to authority,
only to outcome.

---

### Q6: Why ignore spacecraft data?

This model does not depend on spaceflight.

Introducing spacecraft telemetry would reintroduce
the very spatial assumptions the model is testing.

This is deliberate isolation, not ignorance.

---

### Q7: Isn’t this just numerology?

No.

Numerology does not define:
- phase windows,
- tolerance thresholds,
- refinement procedures,
- or independent cycles.

This model does.

---

### Q8: Why does this make people angry?

Because it violates an unspoken rule:

> You are allowed to calculate,
> but not to reframe.

This project reframes.

---

### Q9: What would falsify this model?

Any of the following:

- consistent eclipse prediction failure,
- internal mathematical contradiction,
- inability to generalize beyond a narrow epoch,
- or demonstration that time-based geometry cannot scale.

Until then, rejection is emotional, not scientific.

---

### Q10: Is this the final theory?

No.

This is a proof of possibility.

Once possibility is proven,
exclusivity collapses.

That is enough.
