# WHY ORBITAL ASTRONOMY FAILS  
## A Temporal–Geometric Critique

---

### 1. Orbital astronomy assumes what it claims to explain

Orbital astronomy does not derive celestial motion — it **postulates it**.

Elliptical orbits, axial tilt, inclination, and precession are introduced as
**initial conditions**, not as consequences of first principles.

The system is internally consistent only because its assumptions are never questioned.

A model that requires:
- gravity,
- curved spacetime,
- invisible forces,
- and non-observable frames of reference

before producing predictions is **interpretive**, not foundational.

---

### 2. Prediction does not validate mechanism

Orbital astronomy correctly predicts eclipses.

That fact is **not disputed**.

What is disputed is the **logical leap** from prediction to causation.

If two different mathematical systems:
- produce the same predictive output,
- using incompatible mechanisms,

then prediction alone **cannot validate ontology**.

This project demonstrates that eclipses can be predicted **without orbits**.

Therefore, orbits are **not logically necessary**.

### 3. Time is treated as secondary — incorrectly

In orbital models:
- time parameterizes motion,
- geometry is primary,
- dynamics are assumed.

This hierarchy is arbitrary.

There is no proof that space must govern time.

This model reverses the dependency:
- time governs geometry,
- geometry governs appearance,
- appearance produces events.

Nothing breaks.

### 4. The analemma is explained away, not explained

In classical astronomy, the analemma is explained as a compound artifact of:
- axial tilt,
- orbital eccentricity,
- Earth’s motion.

This explanation is **descriptive**, not functional.

The analemma has no active role in eclipse logic.

In this model, the analemma:
- directly modulates solar altitude,
- gates eclipse permissibility,
- functions as a control variable.

If a phenomenon can be functional, but is treated as incidental,
the model is incomplete.

### 5. Orbital inclination is a geometric crutch

Inclined planes are introduced to explain why eclipses do not occur every month.

This introduces:
- hidden angles,
- invisible planes,
- abstract intersections.

This project replaces inclination with **temporal nodal windows**.

The same effect is achieved with:
- fewer assumptions,
- no spatial tilting,
- no precession.

When two models explain the same constraint, the simpler one is preferable.

### 6. Earth’s shadow is an assumption, not a measurement

No one has ever measured Earth’s shadow in space.

It is inferred.

In orbital astronomy, the Earth’s shadow is:
- always present,
- always correctly aligned,
- always the correct size.

This is never independently validated.

This model produces lunar eclipses **without invoking Earth’s shadow**.

Therefore, the shadow is not required.

### 7. Orbital astronomy cannot explain why time works

The Saros cycle works.
Synodic periods work.
Draconic cycles work.

Orbital astronomy **inherits** these cycles.

It does not explain why time itself is so regular.

This project treats time as the governing structure, not a byproduct.

That is why it behaves like a clock.

---

### Conclusion

Orbital astronomy is not wrong.

It is **overdetermined**.

It explains celestial phenomena by embedding them in a spatial narrative
that is not uniquely required by the data.

This project demonstrates that a **flat, stationary, time-governed model**
can reproduce eclipse behavior with fewer ontological commitments.

That alone is sufficient to expose orbital astronomy as **non-exclusive**.

And non-exclusive explanations are not foundations — they are traditions.
